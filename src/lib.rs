//! In Module 1, we discussed Block ciphers like AES. Block ciphers have a fixed length input.
//! Real wold data that we wish to encrypt _may_ be exactly the right length, but is probably not.
//! When your data is too short, you can simply pad it up to the correct length.
//! When your data is too long, you have some options.
//!
//! In this exercise, we will explore a few of the common ways that large pieces of data can be
//! broken up and combined in order to encrypt it with a fixed-length block cipher.
//!
//! WARNING: ECB MODE IS NOT SECURE.
//! Seriously, ECB is NOT secure. Don't use it irl. We are implementing it here to understand _why_
//! it is not secure and make the point that the most straight-forward approach isn't always the
//! best, and can sometimes be trivially broken.
